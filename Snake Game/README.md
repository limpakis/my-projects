# Snake Game â€“ Project Overview

## Description

This project is a modern take on the classic Snake game, developed using the **`raylib`** graphics library. The player controls a snake that grows by eating apples and must avoid obstacles such as eagles. The gameplay is simple, yet engaging, with responsive controls and smooth visual feedback.

## Usage
**Compile and Run the program:**  
   ```sh
   cd programs/game
   make run //using the MakeFile
   ```
## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation between game logic and graphical interface for maintainability and scalability.
- **Dynamic Object Management**: Game objects like apples and eagles are managed efficiently to ensure balanced gameplay.
- **Optimized Performance**: Snake movement is handled in constant time (O(1)), even as the snake grows.
- **Visual & Audio Feedback**: Real-time rendering, sound effects, and background music enhance user experience.
- **User Interaction**: Supports pausing, restarting, and debugging features.

## Technologies Used

- **C programming language**
- **raylib** (for graphics, input, and audio)
- **Custom Data Structures** (Lists, Maps) for efficient game state management

## Outcome

The result is a clean, performant, and visually interactive Snake game that demonstrates solid software design principles, optimized algorithms, and real-time graphics handling.
