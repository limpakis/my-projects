# 🚗 Car Brand Identifier (Gemini + Streamlit)

[![Streamlit App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Demo-Streamlit%20App-brightgreen?logo=streamlit)](https://carrecognitionproject.streamlit.app)

Identify car **brands** from photos or logos using **Google’s Gemini multimodal LLM**.  
Upload an image → get the brand name, confidence score, and enriched details such as **headquarters, founding year, parent company, founders, country, website,** and a **Wikipedia summary** — all in a clean, interactive UI.

## ✨ Features

- 🔎 **Car brand recognition** from logos and car photos  
- 📊 **Confidence score** with model rationale  
- 🌍 **Live enrichment** using Wikidata/Wikipedia (HQ, founded, parent company, country, website, summary)  
- ⚡ **Caching** for faster repeated lookups  
- 🎨 Simple, responsive UI built with **Streamlit**

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Upload** a car logo or photo.  
2. The app sends the image to **Gemini** with a structured JSON prompt.  
3. Gemini responds with a prediction, e.g.:  
   ```json
   {
     "brand": "BMW",
     "confidence": 0.95,
     "rationale": "Recognized the blue-white roundel logo"
   }
   ```  
4. The app **enriches** the result with Wikidata & Wikipedia details.  
5. The output is displayed as an interactive **brand card**.
